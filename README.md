## Ant types
 - Foragers
 - Larvaes
 - Queen
 - Soldiers
 - Workers

## Goals
 - âœ… Ant wanders around
 - Forager will look for food
 - Forager will bring back food to colony
 - Forager will lay pheromone trail from food source to colony
 - Queen will initiate colony splitting
 - Queen will lay eggs
 - Soldier will carry heavy loads of food
 - Soldier will defend colony from intruders
 - Worker will care for queen and larvaes
 - Worker will feed fungus
